# This code tries to solve a particular problem by three different strategies,
# estimate the probability of success of each strategy by stochastic simulation
# and do some investigation of one strategy which performs surprisingly better.

# The problem: A room contains 2n boxes numbered from 1 to 2n. There are 2n
#              cards, each printed with a unique number from 1 to 2n and
#              randomly placed one in each box. 2n prisoners numbered from 1 to
#              2n need to find the card with their number on it by opening a 
#              maximum on n boxes. After each prisonerâ€™s go, the room is set to
#              its original state and communication is not allowed. If all
#              prisoners succeed in finding their number, then they all go free.

# Strategy 1: The prisoner starts at the box with their number on it, opens it
#             and find the card with number i. If i is not the prisoner number,
#             they go to box number i, open it and repeat the process until they
#             have either found the card with their number on it, or opened n 
#             boxes without finding it.
# Strategy 2: As strategy 1, but starting from a randomly selected box.
# Strategy 3: They open n boxes at random, checking each card for their number.

# The difference among individual success probabilities is not large.

# Analysis:
# Intuitively, the probability of loop length exceeding 50 is very small,
# which allows us to get a relatively high probability of success.
