# This code tries to solve a particular problem by three different strategies,
# estimate the probability of success of each strategy by stochastic simulation
# and do some investigation of one strategy which performs surprisingly better.

# The problem: A room contains 2n boxes numbered from 1 to 2n. There are 2n
#              cards, each printed with a unique number from 1 to 2n and
#              randomly placed one in each box. 2n prisoners numbered from 1 to
#              2n need to find the card with their number on it by opening a 
#              maximum on n boxes. After each prisonerâ€™s go, the room is set to
#              its original state and communication is not allowed. If all
#              prisoners succeed in finding their number, then they all go free.

# Strategy 1: The prisoner starts at the box with their number on it, opens it
#             and find the card with number k. If k is not their prisoner number,
#             they go to box number k, open it and repeat the process until they
#             have either found the card with their number on it, or opened n 
#             boxes without finding it.
# Strategy 2: As strategy 1, but starting from a randomly selected box.
# Strategy 3: They open n boxes at random, checking each card for their number.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Remarks on the result
# Individual success probability of each strategy range from about 0.4 to 0.5.
# The difference among each probability is not large.
# However, there is huge difference in joint probability. 
# Joint success probability of strategy 1 is surprisingly high, with about 0.3,
# but Joint success probability of strategy 2&3 are close to 0.
# The result is more obvious when n becomes larger.

# Analysis:
# When we perform the experiment with n=50. We can see from the graph 
# that a loop of length 1 has a higher probability compared to the other lengths.
# And as the length increases, the probability decreases abruptly. 
# When the length of the loop exceeds 50, the probability tends to zero.
# This is keeping up with our rules that the maximum number of boxes 
# that can be opened is n=50, otherwise it is considered a failure. 
# Therefore the probability of success in a loop of these lengths should be 0.
